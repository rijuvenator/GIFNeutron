# Currents

This is a home for `attenhut`, which is just a tabular format for the scraped currents, and for the plotting script.

I didn't automate adding the attenuations out front. It's straightforward; make a list of the measurements, grep/awk on meta, and copy them in.

Note that for TB5, there seems to be some missing data.

The following measurements were borrowed:
  * 3239 copied from 3237
  * 3250 copied from 3249
  * 3254 copied from 3253
