added meta for 1883, 1814, 2526 manually
added HV0 for 1779, 1897, 1903 manually

to compare between meta_final and meta:

# for measurements meta_final and meta have in common, sorted,
# diff the line in meta_final with the line in meta, with the last argument and space stripped off
# in the future just do diff <(grep ^$i meta) <(grep ^$i meta_final), since I'm about to copy over the FF
for i in `comm -12 <(awk '{print $1}' meta | sort) <(awk '{print $1}' meta_final | sort)`
do
	diff <(grep ^$i meta | awk '{$NF=""; sub(/ $/,"",$0); print}') <(grep ^$i meta_final)
done
